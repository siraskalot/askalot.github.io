<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Arunan, a designer & front–end developer. Besides being a geek — I am also a maker of music, videos and art; and have a passion for food and travel.</p>


<p>When I'm not a professional geek, ranting about web standards or being obsessive about GNU/Linux & Macs; I can be found annoying serenading my neighbours with my musical skills, shooting anything & everything (with a camera of course!) or doodling penguins everywhere.</p>
