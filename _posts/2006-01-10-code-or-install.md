After deciding that we needed to promote The Linux Center further, we decided to have an "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installfest">installfest</a>"; and <a href="http://www.raramimu.blogspot.com">Suchetha</a> announced it on the lk-lug list. Then (Doc) Nandalal suggested a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remaster">remaster</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codefest">codefest</a> as well... so I stuck in my request for help with <span>Mango OS</span>. This was follwed by a mail-based-chat; between doc and me...

After several lengthy replies I went to bed; and turned up on time the next day... :-o

Anyway doc showed off <a href="http://www.txoutcome.org/">OIO</a>; and also found out that the <a href="http://www.puppylinux.org/">puppy</a> he had brought was <a href="http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/">damn-small</a>. Soon others (<a href="http://budlite.blogspot.com/">Bud</a>, <a href="http://kosala-atapattu.blogspot.com/">Kosala</a>, <a href="http://anuradha.wordpress.com/">Anuradha.W</a> and Janith) showed up, and were assigned tasks... to enhance Mango OS ("mhuhaahaahaa"). Later others turned up with machines to get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux">GNU/Linux</a> installed on them.

We got quite a lot of work done (w.r.t Mango OS)...

* Cleaned up the installer and post install.
* Tested <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WiFi">WiFi</a> support.
* Added and tested <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth">bluetooth</a> support.
* Added new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE">KDE</a> window decorations.
* Forced some Mango OS (5.0.7) installs... though most of 'em liked it after install... :-o

Next we did several installfest-installs... not many turned up for that sadly.

At about 4.00 p.m. people (coders) started to leave. Then the others (installfest guests) left as well; and <a href="http://www.anutux.blogspot.com/">Anuradha.D</a> showed up with <a href="http://tuskytux.blogspot.com/">Kunchana</a>... and I decided to stay since it was late and had no transport back home. We watched "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Royale">Battle Royale</a>", and stayed till 5.00 a.m. the next day.

Not a bad day, at least not for Mango OS... :-D
