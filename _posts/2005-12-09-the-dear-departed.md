After long postponement, we got around to moving the final bits-and-pieces ( several tables and racks) out of our previous location.

When I got there, I found that the expected lorry hadn't arrived, so we had to run around the city to find one to transport the furniture (which proved a really hard task; especially since it was a Sunday afternoon).

After loading the lorry with furniture, we dumped the rest of the stuff in <a href="http://www.raramimu.blogspot.com/">Suchetha</a>'s van, and left for "The Linux Center". There we unloaded the stuff, after the lorry crashed into several walls (and bent a rack...); while trying to get into the narrow lane of the "center".

I hadn't done any lifting (or any other strenuous physical activity...) for a while; so even though I was the youngest, I was more of an obstruction, than help (especially since my tummy kept getting in the way! :-D)

We will surely miss our earlier location, but the new one has a more homely feel... hopefully it will grow from strength to strength...
