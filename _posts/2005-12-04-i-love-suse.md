The previous night I decided to stay over at 'The Linux Center'. After having a bad experience with <a href="http://www.anutux.blogspot.com/">Anuradha.D</a>'s laptop and 'Mango OS' (where I accidentally erased his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record">MBR</a>, manually... , and had to recover it using <a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk">Test-Disk</a>...); I left for home at 7.00 a.m. in the morning.

There I found that i had to attend a wedding (yes another one; after all this is the wedding season...). After the wedding, I came home and caught some "shut-eye".

In the middle of my slumber, I (am supposed to have...) got a call from <a href="http://raramimu.blogspot.com/">Suchetha</a>, asking me to come to the exhibition venue; which I (supposedly...) answered and went to sleep! After waking up at 7.00 p.m. My brother told me about my little "sleeping-and-call-answering" adventure, so I called Suchetha to see what had happened. Thus I found that the exhibition was not over, and practically ran (as fast as my physique permitted...) to the bus halt and caught a bus there.

At the exhibition I found Suchetha and <a href="http://netbuglk.deviantart.com/">Wasantha</a> having dinner (beer and hotdogs.. :-D); and joined them for a bite (I had fish-rolls). After that we went in and promoted(?) <a href="http://www.opensuse.org/Welcome_to_openSUSE.org">SUSE</a> Linux (since the official vendors of SUSE were the people who had invited us).

There were quite a few people who visited us, but most (all?) of them were not familiar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU">GNU</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>!!!

Also during the same time, some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux">tux</a>es were caught in mischeivous acts... Later I got a tour of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> stall, and went "gaga" over the ipods, ibooks and macs that I saw...

When I got back to the stall Wasantha started demostrating <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> to me. At about 9.30 we decided to leave. On our way out we saw a dance(!!!?) going on in the next hall (but the banners hung in there were also indicating an e-carnival... :D).

Though we couldn't promote SUSE too much, we can be happy about one thing... Our stuffed-toy-tuxes got to go out for a day! ;D
