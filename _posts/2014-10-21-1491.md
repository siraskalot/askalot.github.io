[Charles C. Mann](http://www.theatlantic.com/charles-c-mann/) (emphasis mine):

>Before it became the New World, the Western Hemisphere was vastly more populous and sophisticated than has been thoughtâ€”an altogether more salubrious place to live at the time than, say, Europe. New evidence of both the extent of the population and its agricultural advancement leads to a remarkable conjecture: **the Amazon rain forest may be largely a human artifact**


Quite long and rather interesting read!
