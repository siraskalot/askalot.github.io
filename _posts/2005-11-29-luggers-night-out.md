After having a crazy weeked, and seeing Harshula's mail on the list, I decided to attend the dinner for lklug-gers. It started raining, just after I got out of my front door; so I had to stand in the rain at the bus halt.

After getting to the venue I found <a href="http://raramimu.blogspot.com/">Suchetha</a> waiting at the entrance to show us to our seats. Plenty of well known faces were there; including the three Anuradhas (<a href="http://anuradha-ratnaweera.blogspot.com/">Ratnaweera</a>, <a href="http://anuradha.wordpress.com/">Weeraman</a> &amp; <a href="http://anutux.blogspot.com/">Dasun</a>), <a href="http://kosala-atapattu.blogspot.com/">Kosala</a>, <a href="http://sanjaya-ratnaweera.blogspot.com/">Sanjaya</a> and Harshula. Some others turned up later including <a href="http://budlite.blogspot.com/">Bhuddhika</a> and Kanchana.

We ordered a <del>decent</del> **splendid** dinner and cleaned our plates up (literally!). It was a welcome change for my palette, since I had only visited the venue only once before. Comments, stories and of course geek-talk was exchanged during dinner; and after it, until 10.00 p.m.

During dinner ideas to (hopefully) start a "lklug-floss-magazine", and quickly put out a copy of "Mango OS" were put forward. Then we left, for home.

Quite a change from the regular hyperactive lklug activities, this opportunity to relax and socialise was very welcome.
