[Vanessa Hua](http://vanessahua.com/):

>You can design a highly functional replica of the human breast, but it only improves upon one aspect of the laborious, gear-laden bottle-feeding process. We’ll just have to wait for inventors to deliver a full-service milk robot, a latter-day wet nurse — something so advanced it seems ancient.

Interesting to know that what I once thought was an ordinary object had a design process, design issues and that it only solves part of the problem.
