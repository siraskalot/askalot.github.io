Svetlana Z:

>I paid someone to write my ad copy. I paid professional photographers $1,500 to shoot my pictures. I considered those investments in myself.

And ...

>I spent $50 a day on Eros so I could be listed in the “What’s New” section, and I learned that to have an impact I had to be “new” for at least 20 days a month. I spent $500 a week for a “featured” spot. So that’s almost $4,000 a month right there. The girls who would only spend the basic $400 a month, they’d only get one email in two weeks. They’d be sitting at home, sucking their fingers.

Clearly she understands that to make money, you need to spend money - something a lot of business folk do not seem to comprehend.

Also and understands capitalism ...

>I loved doing couples, but I charged more than twice as much. I got $2,000 an hour, and the sessions were usually at least two hours. I charged more not because the work was harder — it obviously wasn’t — but because I could. That’s the cool thing about capitalism.

Worth a read, for a perspective on a capitalist take on the oldest profession in the world.
