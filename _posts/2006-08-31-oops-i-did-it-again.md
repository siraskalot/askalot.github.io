No this is NOT a post on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Obejcts Oriented Programming System</a>.
Nor one about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oops%21..._I_Did_It_Again">song</a>.

This is just to let you know that I go (try to) play tennis with my uncle and aunt semi-regularly.
And **drumroll** I ripped my pants... twice! ("dagnabbit' I need to loose weight!)

But playing  tennis is fun, so is panting and puffing and trying to catch up with my uncle and aunt when they go for a jog. ;-D
